This is a failed project that ultimately didn't work out because of performance issues on my 800 mhz Mac. I might revisit this someday to truly rebuild it into what could have been, but for now, it's only kept here for archiving purposes. Nothing of note anyway apart from the vertical titlebar icons. If those interest you, you can look [here](awesome/themes/gruvbox/titlebar/).
