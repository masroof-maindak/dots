This is a failed project that ultimately didn't work out because of performance issues on my 800 mhz Mac. I might revisit it someday with a better laptop to truly build it into what could have been, but for now, it's only kept here for archiving purposes. Nothing of note anyway apart from the vertical titlebar icons. If those interest you, you can look [here](./themes/gruvbox/titlebar/).
