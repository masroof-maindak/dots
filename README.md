This repository contains all my dotfiles, and was made primarily for archiving purposes. I've attempted to store new configs/changes incrementally rather than replacing the prior versions.

Furthermore, it has been split into two portions; one for my laptop, and the other for my computer, because of varying screen DPIs, modules, distros, etc.

To get started following a minimal Arch install:
> git clone https://github.com/masroof-maindak/dots<br>
> chmod +x bootstrap.sh<br>
> ./bootstrap.sh
