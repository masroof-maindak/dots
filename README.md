This repository contains all my dotfiles, and was made primarily for archiving purposes. I've attempted to store new configs/changes incrementally rather than replacing the prior versions.

Furthermore, it has been split into two portions; one for my laptop, and the other for my computer, because of varying display protocols (Wayland on the latter), screen DPIs, modules, etc.

I have also written a small collection of steps on setting up a fresh Arch install on a Macbook (once again, largely for my own convenience) which you can find on my website.
