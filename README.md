This repository contains all my dotfiles. I've attempted to store new configs/colour themes incrementally rather than replacing the prior versions. 

Furthermore, it has been split into two portions; one for my laptop, and the other for my computer, largely because of varying display protocols (Wayland on the latter).

I have also (primarily for self-reference), written a small collection of steps on setting up a fresh Arch install on a Macbook which you can find [here](https://github.com/MujtabaAsim/Misc/blob/main/ArchOnMac.md).
